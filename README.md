# Hi there! 👋
I'm Ola, a ruby developer with 9 years of experience in crafting roby/RoR web applications. If you'll ever need to explain to a frontend developer how to create a simple API using RoR, feel free to use the [tutorial I've created](https://github.com/paziolka/koalapp) ~~for charity~~ for koalas 🐨, after the 2020 Australian bushfires.
Currently, I'm diving into the exciting world of Python. Privately, I'm passionate about rock climbing (I know, how original...) and my favorite animal is marine iguana 🦎.

## What I'm Up To

I’m currently working on mastering Python! Check out my Python projects: [a simple FastAPI for geo projects](https://github.com/paziolka/geo_projects) and [a simple DjangoGirls blog](https://github.com/paziolka/dg_blog) where I've added some tests using pytest.

## Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out for collaborations, discussions, or just to say hello! 🚀
